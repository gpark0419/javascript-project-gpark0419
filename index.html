            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have lived and studied in several countries, including Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and the United
                States (Philadelphia and Illinois). My interest in technology began at Dominican International School in
                Taipei, where I took AP Computer Science courses (CSA and CSP) and developed skills in Java, Python, and
                SQL. This experience sparked my passion for solving technical problems and motivated me to expand my
                skill set.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am studying at Knox College, where I am deepening my knowledge in programming languages and
                statistics. I have learned Java, Python, SQL, C#, C++, Haskell, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Additionally,
                I am gaining practical experience as an ITS Helpdesk worker on campus.</p>

<!-- This code begins with the standard HTML5 declaration and includes basic metadata in the <head> section, such as character encoding set to UTF-8, viewport settings for responsive design, the page title, and a link to an external CSS file (styles.css) for styling.
In the <body> section, a <header> element displays the main navigation and branding of the website. On the left side, it includes the user’s name, "Guk Gi Park," linked to the "About Me" section, and a profile picture (CS208Profile.jpg). In the center, there is a "Site Title" element within a <div class="site-title">. On the right side, the header contains a navigation menu with links to other sections of the page: "Publications," "CV," "Portfolio," and "Contact."
A <div class="design-line"> immediately follows the header, serving as a decorative horizontal line that visually separates the header from the main content.
The main content of the page is organized within the <main> element, which contains multiple <section> elements, each corresponding to a specific section of the portfolio. The "About Me" section provides an introduction and background information about the user. The "Publications" section lists journal papers with placeholders for lab publications labeled "Preprints" and "Peer reviewed," along with messages indicating "Coming soon." The "CV" section details the user’s education, work experience, and a list of technical skills. The "Portfolio" section contains three sample portfolio items, each with a short description. Finally, the "Contact" section includes contact information, such as an email address.
At the bottom of the body, a <script> tag links to an external JavaScript file (scripts.js), which is to manages interactivity, such as showing and hiding sections based on user navigation clicks.-->
